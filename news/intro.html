<h3 class="western">Introduction to Guess.Market</h3>
<p><a href="https://app.guess.market/?src=med7" target="_blank">Guess.Market</a>
is where we guess future and get paid for guessing.</p>
<p>Everyone gets a say. In fact we want everyone’s input, because
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/46/16385" target="_blank">once
we increase diversity, inherent biases cancel each other</a> and we
end up with true signals.</p>
<p>It is ok to follow your gut! (Did you know you actually have <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gut-second-brain/" target="_blank">a
lot of neurons</a> around your gut area?)</p>
<p>But we don’t blindly combine everyone’s guesses equally. We
look at your history and come up with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7563" target="_blank">clever
algorithms</a> that combine everyone’s inputs in more effective
ways.</p>
<p>Once you get better at your guesses you will be paid dramatically
more. Educate yourself, study, get better at it, we pay you a lot
more than others.</p>
<p>We start with guessing <a href="https://bitcoin.org/" target="_blank">bitcoin</a>.
It is kind of transparent and everyone can follow it and the
resources are widely available. Hopefully we will guess more things
in the following months.</p>
<p>You’ll be paid in coins (Guess.Market coins) which you can
withdraw once your account reaches an amount and a accuracy threshold
(i.e. we don’t like spammers).</p>
<p>This is a place where we study markets, understand the factors
that change prices, predict directions and trade based on sentiment
of other people.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Currently, using <a href="https://app.guess.market/?src=med8" target="_blank">the
app</a> you will get:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Average sentiment of all users
	based on news</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Average future price guesses of
	users and price targets of technical analysis</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Aggregate data and predictions
	based on those data</p>
	<li/>
<p>And much more</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>You’ll be able to get notifications:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When big news happen</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When there is price volatility</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When some aggregate data change</p>
	<li/>
<p>When some predictions change</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>At the end by using Guess.Market you’ll be more informed than
others when trading or investing. The main output of Guess.Market is
meaningful trading signals.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: Read news + look at data + guess price + earn coins
+ profit collectively.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="western">Coins</h3>
<p>But this isn’t just an app. Here, everyone can be a data
producer and also a data consumer. The data production is done
through tasks. Currently production is voluntary and consumption is
free.</p>
<p>Guess.Market will have gamification with cryptocurrency economics.
You’ll be able to improve your knowledge by studying and playing.
You’ll also be able to turn your knowledge into cash. Make money
predicting markets!</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p><h3 class="western">Current research in the&nbsp;app</h3>
<p>We are researching social sentiment vs price for about 18 months now.
	We show our finding to users as in sentiment from each source as well as predictions of our models based on each source.
	We also do paper trading and let algorithms give weights to models based on paper trading results.
	Cleverly aggregated, the final model should be more effective than individual models.
</p>

<p>We combine everyone's price guesses into one so that it is a lot easier to digest.
	Humans prefer simpler and beautiful things to look at.
	The data and predictions produced by algorithms feeded back to users for users to get better at their decisions.
	It should be a good feedback loop for the project to succeed.
</p>

<p>The ultimate numbers are free for now for everyone's enjoyment. We currently don't trade it but we'll do it if the paper trading results get long enough (and successful enough).
	Now we record the history.

<h3 class="western">Similar Projects</h3>
<p><a href="https://erasure.xxx/" target="_blank">Erasure</a> — Some
sophisticated people invested in Numerai, as far as I see, and they
are building Erasure, which is like decentralized version of
Guess.Market. You don’t have to share your data with a centralized
entity in this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://goodjudgment.com/" target="_blank">Good
Judgement</a> — Government organized thousands of people to
guess what will happen in global scale to countries, markets,&nbsp;…
The crowd did better than professionals! Did you know that right now
some intelligence agencies have prediction markets in them? Usually
when people see other’s opinions it is not the most efficient. The
ones with higher followers will start to change other’s opinions,
ending up congested areas of opinions without original thinking. But
it can also end up forecasters getting more informed about the
question, and not everyones Bayesian update to every data would be
the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://cindicator.com/" target="_blank">Cindicator</a> — A
team with experience for several years. Collecting price guesses,
binary guesses and such for markets, creating signals and everyone
can be a consumer and producer of data. They are the biggest consumer
of data and biggest producer of machine learning models in their
ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://cindicator.com/" target="_blank">Augur</a> — A
totally decentralized prediction market on Ethereum, which could not
get much adoption, partly because I think bad UX, congested Ethereum
network and maybe just not enough volume inside their markets.&nbsp;</p>

</p><h3 class="western">Will it&nbsp;work?</h3>
<p>It is always the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank">exploration
vs exploitation, which <em>multi armed bandit</em></a> to choose? And
we’re attacking that problem with incentives in the game, i.e. the
explorers will be paid with coins. Later we might bring also skin in
the game, i.e. the explorers will stake their coins. “Which
explorers to trust” is yet another problem. There are ways to let
explorers explore that as well, current project of Numerai involves
that. Current explorer of machine learning models is Guess.Market in
our project.</p>
<p>If we are serious we should buy the prediction that it will work,
in a <em>prediction market</em>, (<em>at a good price</em>)! If
someone creates a market for whether prediction markets will be a
huge thing or not we will be a happy participant.</p>
