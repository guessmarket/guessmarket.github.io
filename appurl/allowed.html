        <h3>Allowed Post Types</h3>

        <div style ="text-align:left;">
            <h4>General Rules</h4>

            <ul><li>The post should not contain anything not suitable to the platform or not safe for work.

            <li>The post should not be duplicate. A duplicate is a post which has very close ideas/info about another post already on Guess.Market. Or to put it another way, having the duplicate on platform will not improve anything.  A post can talk about other things, but if the key info or idea that moves the price is same, then the posts are the same. Non price related text is not a differentiator.  Frequently similar piece of news regarding one main event, can be posted on several platforms within several hours. These can have little or no differentiating info.
            <li>The price movement should be expected in the future, i.e. the news should not be *only* about past prices.</li>
            <li>The expectation should be a significant move in price. A 0.5% move may be just a noise in crypto space.
            </ul>
            <br />
            Here are some post types that we want to see:
            <br />

            <h4>An event that moves price a lot</h4>
            Examples:<br />
            <ul>
               <li>A regulator has comments about cryptocurrencies, or bans something
               <li>A bug in a blockchain
               <li>An exchange is hacked or raided by regulatory bodies
               <li>An exchange malfunctions or taken offline abruptly
               <li>Market manipulation or big sell off
               <li>A country has coup, war or decides to inflate its currency massively
            </ul>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>A news article that will affect bitcoin's price dramatically</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>A news or blog article that contains significant events. Examples above.
               <li>The news should be about bitcoin or general cryptocurrencies because most of coins can be bought with BTC.
            </ul>
            <br />
            <h4>
                Technical analysis that describes possible price moves
            </h4>
            Technical analysis is in play with cryptocurrencies. A good technical analysis will tell us where the price can go.
            <br /> Check the analyst's credentials, knowledge, reputation, username, real name, even picture and try to understand how creditworthy she is.
            <br /> It is better if it specifies probabilities. If a trader is talking like an oracle, probably you should run away. A good indicator
            is whether she talks about potential price movements, not certainty.
            <br /> Check her previous analysis and whether the previous ones were predictive.
            <br/>
            <br />Good examples:<br />
            <ul>
            <li>There is 30% probability the price will move up 1%, and 70% probability that it will fall 5%.</li>
            <li>10000 will possibly be a resistance level because of the 50 day MA crossing. We expect price to hit resistance and go down from there.
                But if it breaks 10000 up then a move to 11000 is most probable.
            <li>This long term support trend line around 6K is strong, we don't expect price action to break it and go down. We expect a pull back to 6500 levels.
            </ul>

            <br />Bad ones:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>If the TA is too vague, and does not say much, there is no value to it.
                <li>If it lists all the possibilities that can happen without mentioning the likelihood of each, again there is not much value, because it just lists all the things that can happen.
                <li>If it contains a lot of drawings in it or a lot of indicators, probably it is also of little value. One can produce almost any story with enough art. We don't need good art, we need good predictions on simplest charts.
                </ul>
