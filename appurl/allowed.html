            <h4>News article that will affect bitcoin's price</h4>

            The news should be about bitcoin, exchanges, regulation or anything else that will move bitcoin's price a lot. It should be significant news otherwise moderators will flag or remove it.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>
                Technical analysis that Describe possible price moves
            </h4>
            Technical analysis is in play with cryptocurrencies. A good technical analysis will tell us where the price can go.
            <br /> It is better if it says there is that amount of probability the price will move to here, or that amount of probability for the reverse action.
            <br />Examples:<br />
            If price hits a target level it can bounce from that area, if it doesn't further move can be seen.<br />
            If this trend line is hit, price will most probably reverse.<br />

            If the TA is too vague, and does not say much, there is no value to it. It will be removed. If it lists all the possibilities that can happen without mentioning the likelihood of each, again there is not much value. If it contains a lot of drawings in it or a lot of indicators, probably it is also of little value. We don't need people who can draw, we need good predictions on simplest charts.

            <h4>General Rules</h4>

            The post should not contain anything not suitable to the platform or not safe for work.
            <br />
            The post should not be duplicate. A duplicate is a post which has very close ideas/info about another post already on Guess.Market. Or to put it another way, having the duplicate on platform will not improve anything.  A post can talk about other things, but if the key info or idea that moves the price is same, then the posts are the same. Non price related text is not a differentiator.  Frequently similar piece of news regarding one main event, can be posted on several platforms within several hours. These can have little or no differentiating info.
