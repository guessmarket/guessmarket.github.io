        <h3>Ways to Earn Coins</h3>

        <div style ="text-align:left;">
            <h4>Correctly predicting the market</h4>
Guess.Market depends on these market predictions about the market direction. Correctly and consistently predicting these movements will make the system recognize your valuable input.
            Basically your sentiments will get more and more attention if you keep up the good work.
You may start gaining more coins per each of your individual predictions because the system is probably getting to know and trust you more.
If however you try to guess the market in every news even though you are not knowledgable about the topic, and without thinking about it for a while, you'll end up with wrong predictions, providing the system too much noise and this will result in low signal to noise ratio. The system may not select you for further consideration. You may gradually earn less and less coins or maybe lose some.

            <h4>Adding news</h4>
            If you find an article, news, tweet, technical analysis or other kind of posts that is allowed on Guess.Market platform, you should add it.
If you add before others, and others add similar posts regarding the same event, your post will likely stay on the platform as unique and the others will be marked duplicate.
Generally you will earn coins in proportion to number of times your news is read and number of times it is marked important.
If the user that marked your news important is holding big amount of coins, and he has good experience and fame on the platform, you may end up earning more.
If the readers can also predict the market up or down, thanks to your news, you may also earn more.
If however your news is flagged, you may end up losing coins.

            <h4>Impact prediction</h4>
This is done via pressing the important button. If you think the post is very important, you should press this button.
Basically the system will try to bring the news to others if it is predicted to be important by the previous readers. Everyone wants to read important news. So it is the system's job to optimize the opening and reading of the news. Also, if the news is important the system has to notify more people in order to collect more votes. More votes are usually better aggregate prediction.
The system may also reward more coins to first predictors of impact. Because the first seconds of a breaking news are the most important, if you spot the most significant news and press the important button before others it is a very cruical data and should be rewarded accordingly.
However if you say everything is important, your signal will diminish in value and will be disregarded by the system. You may even lose coins if you use the button the wrong way.

            <br />
            <h4>Free guesses</h4>
The system can ask you to guess freely, not reading a news or looking at a technical analysis. You should consider all the things that you experienced and guess freely. This can be totally intuition.
You don't have to think about the reasons that you are guessing so and so. Be free and independent. In fact research shows that if you be more and more independent the average guesses of the whole crowd are more correct.
Do not look at anybody's guesses. Do not feel constrained. Just throw some numbers while not forgetting that you'll earn more if you guess closer to future reality.

            <h4>
                Flagging and moderation
            </h4>
If you find a post to be not allowed, you can flag it. You may earn coins if majority of other moderators think alike.
However if majority thinks that your flagging is wrong, you may lose coins.
The participants in a flagging and moderation run may share the coins with each other.
If you flag a news before others, you may earn the most coins, because you made the first discovery.
