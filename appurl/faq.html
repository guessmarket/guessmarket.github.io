            <h4>What is the formula for calculating rewards?</h4>

Currently we are mostly experimenting with different formulas. We always want to bring quality content and best contributers to our platform. For that we have to find the best approaches that work.
            From time to time the reward calculations can change slightly or dramatically.
            It will be hard for us to constantly announce the formulas. If things calm down, we can start talking about how we calculate the coins.
